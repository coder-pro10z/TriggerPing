Here is your tailored Docker.md for the learning version of Trigger-ping using FastAPI + Uvicorn (main.py) and Python 3.11:


---

🐳 Docker Setup — Trigger-ping (Learning Version)

This guide walks you through containerizing the Trigger-ping FastAPI service using Docker and Docker Compose.


---

✅ Prerequisites

Requirement	Version

Python (local, for development)	3.11
Docker Engine	≥ 20.x
Docker Compose	≥ 1.29



---

📁 Example Project Structure

trigger-ping/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py          # FastAPI app (app = FastAPI())
│   ├── requirements.txt # fastapi, uvicorn, etc
├── Dockerfile
└── docker-compose.yml


---

🛠️ Dockerfile

FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY app/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY app/ .

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]


---

▶️ Build the Docker Image

docker build -t trigger-ping .


---

🚀 Run the Container (Direct)

docker run -p 8000:8000 --name trigger-ping trigger-ping

Then open: http://localhost:8000


---

⚙️ docker-compose.yml (Optional but Recommended)

version: "3.9"

services:
  trigger-ping:
    build: .
    container_name: trigger-ping
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    restart: unless-stopped

Run it with:

docker compose up --build
