Absolutely! Here's a polished **30-second elevator pitch** tailored for your HR or talent acquisition calls, based on your resume:

---

**💼 Quick Intro Pitch:**

> "Hi, I’m Praveen Kashyap — a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of hands-on experience working with .NET Core and Angular 17. I've contributed to modernizing legacy enterprise systems, enhancing application performance, and implementing scalable front-end solutions. I'm also comfortable working across the entire SDLC, from building APIs to deploying via Azure DevOps and Jenkins. I'm excited about opportunities where I can continue growing in high-impact product teams while contributing to clean, efficient, and user-focused software."

Let me know if you'd like variations based on different job types (e.g., product-based, startup, service-based roles), or if you'd like to add more personality, soft skills, or results.

Here’s a step-by-step rehearsal plan to keep your 30-second pitch smooth, natural, and hesitation-free:

1. **Write & Chunk Your Script**

   * **Divide into 3 segments**:

     1. Who you are (name, role, years)
     2. What you do (core skills/impact)
     3. What you want (your “ask” or interest)
   * **Limit each segment to 1–2 short sentences.** That keeps you from memorizing a long monologue.

2. **Use “Bullet‐Point Prompts”**

   * Instead of memorizing word-for-word, create anchor words on a notecard or slide.

     * E.g. “Name → Role → Legacy → Modernize → SDLC → Azure → Looking for…”
   * When you rehearse, glance at those prompts to jog your memory rather than reciting from script.

3. **Practice Aloud & Record Yourself**

   * **Record** your pitch on your phone or computer.
   * **Listen back** and note any “ums,” “ahs,” or chunks where you stumble.
   * **Re-record** until the flow feels effortless.

4. **Focus on Pacing & Pauses**

   * Aim for about **140 words/minute**—so your 30-sec pitch is \~70 words.
   * **Mark natural pauses** (with slashes in your script) and practice breathing at those points

     > “I’m Praveen Kashyap / a full-stack .NET developer / with two years of experience …”

5. **Warm Up Your Voice**

   * **Diaphragmatic breathing**: inhale for 4 counts, exhale for 6, for 1–2 minutes before practice.
   * **Lip trills** (“brrrr”) or humming to loosen vocal cords.

6. **Shadow & Mirror Work**

   * **Mirror**: practice in front of a mirror to watch your facial expressions and posture.
   * **Shadow**: listen to a polished speaker (e.g., on YouTube) and mimic their rhythm and tone.

7. **Simulate Real Conditions**

   * **Stand up** (as you would during a call) and record.
   * **Use your actual headset or microphone** if you’ll use one in the interview.
   * **Time it**—make sure it fits into 30 seconds without rushing.

8. **Build Muscle Memory**

   * **Rehearse daily** in short sessions (5–10 minutes).
   * **Run through it before any real call** (e.g., during your commute or wait time).

9. **Get Feedback**

   * Practice with a friend or record for yourself, then ask:

     * “Did it feel too fast or slow?”
     * “Was anything unclear or awkward?”
   * Implement one piece of feedback each round.

10. **Embrace Imperfection**

    * If you stumble in a real call, **pause briefly**, take a breath, and continue.
    * Listeners are forgiving—smooth recovery actually demonstrates composure.

By scripting in bite-sized chunks, using prompts, and rehearsing under realistic conditions, you’ll internalize the flow and minimize blocks. Before you know it, that 30-second pitch will roll off your tongue naturally!
